# MATLAB & mexopencv integration bundle #

(C) 2017-2019, Rok Mandeljc


## Summary

This project aims to provide an easy-to-use mexopencv bundle for rapid
OpenCV prototyping with MATLAB. It provides self-contained versions
of OpenCV and mexopencv, along with build scripts and startup scripts
for Linux and Windows.

The main idea is that instead of building mexopencv manually and
having to worry about the compatibility with system's OpenCV version,
a private version of compatible OpenCV and corresponding mexopencv
is built using the provided build script. In addition, provided startup
scripts take care of setting correct library paths, avoiding the
issues with missing imports.


## Prerequisites

The bundle was primarily developed and tested on 64-bit Linux (Fedora 29)
with Matlab R2016b, but has also been tested on 64-bit Windows 10 with
Visual Studio 2015 and Matlab R2016a.


### Linux

A recent 64-bit Linux distribution with basic compilation toolchain
(git, gcc, CMake, make) is required.

In addition, dependencies for building the git checkout of OpenCV are
required. On Fedora, the basic set of development libraries I use can
be installed via:
```Shell
sudo dnf install \
    git \
    cmake \
    gcc-c++ \
    zlib-devel \
    libwebp-devel \
    libjpeg-devel \
    libpng-devel \
    libtiff-devel \
    jasper-devel \
    OpenEXR-devel \
    ffmpeg-devel \
    gstreamer-devel \
    gstreamer-plugins-base-devel \
    libv4l-devel \
    tbb-devel \
    eigen3-devel \
    openblas-devel
```

### Windows

A recent version of  Matlab and working MEX compiler is required.

Make sure that Matlab executable is in PATH; i.e., that you
can start it by running ```matlab``` from Windows command prompt (cmd).

In addition, you will need git and CMake. Make sure that the path to
CMake executable is in PATH.

Ensure that MEX compiler is properly set up in Matlab, and that it
points to the correct Visual Studio installation. You can check this
by running the following inside Matlab:
```Matlab
mex -setup C++
```
and following its instructions for choosing the correct compiler.


## Installation

Checkout the repository to a target location:
```Shell
git clone https://github.com/rokm/matlab_mexopencv matlab_mexopencv
cd matlab_mexopencv
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd ..
```
The above command should also pull in all external dependencies
(opencv, opencv-contrib, mexopencv) as git submodules from their
corresponding repositories.

### Linux

To simplify the build process, use the provided ```build_all.sh``` script.

First, export the path to your matlab installation:
```Shell
export MATLABDIR=/usr/local/MATLAB/R2016b
```

Then, run the build script from your working directory:
```Shell
./matlab_mexopencv/build_all.sh
```

The shell script will attempt to:
- build OpenCV and install it inside the pre-determined sub-directory
  inside the target (checkout) directory
- build mexopencv (using make)

If no errors occurred, the script will print a message about successfully
finishing the build process.

On Linux, the OpenCV shared libraries (required by mexopencv) need to be
in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH before Matlab is started. For convenience, a
startup script is provided which takes care of that for you. Therefore,
to start Matlab, run the following script from your working directory:
```Shell
./matlab_mexopencv/start_matlab.sh
```
It will set up LD_LIBRARY_PATH and run the ```startup.m``` Matlab script
to properly set up paths to external dependencies.


### Windows

Similarly to Linux, a build batch script is available. Open the Windows
Prompt (cmd), and move inside the working directory.

Make sure that Matlab and CMake are in the PATH.

Then, set the Visual Studio version and architecture (required for CMake),
and run the build script from the working directory:
```Batchfile
set "DEFAULT_CMAKE_GENERATOR=Visual Studio 14"
set "DEFAULT_CMAKE_ARCH=x64"

matlab_mexopencv\build_all.bat
```

The script will attempt to:
- build OpenCV and install it inside the pre-determined sub-directory
  inside the code directory
- run Matlab and build mexopencv

If no errors occurred, the script will print a message about successfully
finishing the build process.

On Windows (in contrast to Linux; see above), Matlab can be started
normally - but make sure that the ```startup.m``` is executed before
using the functions and objects from this project.
